# Final-Project

The purpose of this project is to use jupyter notebooks to clean, plot, and analyze data to answer questions on the data. The dataset is on wolf population counts over the years in Denali National Park in Alaska. The questions included:

1) Has there been an increase or decrease in wolf counts over the course of the years?
2) Is there a correlation between the number of wolf packs monitored and the area?
3) What year had the highest number of packs monitored in the spring? How about fall?
4) What is the most common distribution of wolf counts in the spring, is there a difference in the fall?
